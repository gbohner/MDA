         <h1>2-D rigid body Image registration using mutual information.</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>Rigid body 2-D image co-registration (translation and rotation) is performed using maximization of mutual information.</p>
            <p>Function is implemented in c-code and compiled using the Matlab compiler to minimize computation time.</p>
            <p>Mutual information joint entropy matrix is computed using the Hanning windowed sinc function as the kernel of interpolation,
               which is the HPV estimation method [1].
            </p>
            <p>Maximization of the joint entropy matrix is carried out using Powel's Direction set method [2] with original c-code very slightly
               modified from J.P. Moreau's code[3].
